## Package Proxy

This is a Cloudflare Worker that is set as either `uv/pip`'s `index-url`, `cargo`'s `registry` or `npm`'s `registry` and seamlessly proxies requests to the official repositories. For more information please check out the [blog post](https://blog.thinkst.com/2026/06/introducing-package-proxy-supply-chain-safety-checks-without-client-side-software.html).

### Installation
[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fthinkst%2Fpackage-proxy)

#### Client configuration

There's a handy setup script for MacOS in `./scripts/SetupPackageProxy.sh`, simply edit `PACKAGE_PROXY_HOST` with your [sub]-domain of the Cloudflare worker and distribute across your fleet.

Alternatively, here are the manual steps:

1. Set the variable `DOMAIN` to the [sub-]domain where the Worker is running:
   ```$ export DOMAIN=thinkst-package-proxy.mypackageproxy.workers.dev```
2. **pip**:
   ```$ pip config set global.index-url https://$USER@$DOMAIN$/pypi/```
3. **uv**:
   ```$ echo "index-url = \"https://$USER@$DOMAIN/pypi/\"" >> ~/.config/uv/uv.toml```
4. **cargo**:
   ```$ echo -e "[registries]\npackage-proxy = { index = \"sparse+https://$USER@$DOMAIN/\" }\n[source.crates-io]\nreplace-with = \"package-proxy\"" >> ~/.cargo/config.toml```
5. **npm**:
   ```$ npm config set registry https://$DOMAIN && npm config set //$DOMAIN/:_auth=$(echo -n "$USER:" | base64)```

### Registry authentication

By default, the upstream Thinkst worker only checks that an `Authorization` header exists on some routes and still allows tarball downloads without credentials.

This fork adds strict validation when the Worker secret `TOKEN` is configured:

1. Confirm the secret exists in Cloudflare (**Workers → Settings → Variables and secrets**). It should already be named `TOKEN`.

   To rotate or set it via CLI:

   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put TOKEN
   ```

2. Deploy the worker:

   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. Client repos should point npm at the proxy and send the token via `.npmrc` (replace `$PACKAGE_PROXY_DOMAIN` with your Worker hostname):

   ```ini
   registry=https://$PACKAGE_PROXY_DOMAIN
   //$PACKAGE_PROXY_DOMAIN/:_authToken=${NPM_PACKAGE_PROXY_TOKEN}
   ```

   `NPM_PACKAGE_PROXY_TOKEN` is the **local/CI env var name** in consuming repos. Its value must match the Worker secret `TOKEN`.

When the secret is set, **all org-hostname requests** (metadata and `.tgz` downloads) require a matching token sent as either:

- npm `_authToken` → `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- basic auth password → `Authorization: Basic base64(user:<token>)`

If the secret is not configured, the worker keeps the legacy behavior so local/tests do not break.

### Usage

Use the package manager as normal, though if a package version has been removed, the client will simply report it is not found (HTTP 404) and not the specific error/reason for its removal.

### Package Rules
The proxy is defaultly configured to prevent the installation of packages that meet the following criteria:
- Releases newer than 10 days ago (`MIN_AGE_DAYS`)
- Version is not "yanked" (`ALLOW_YANKED`)
- Version is not published in a less-robust manner than the previous release (`ALLOW_CHANGED_PUBLISHER`)
- Specific known-bad releases (prefaced with [PURL type](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec)) such as `npm/axios==0.30.4`, or `pypi/base-x-64: ALL` (`blocklist`)

The remaining configuration options are:
- If `npm audit` can bypass the minimum age (`ALLOW_AUDIT_OVERRIDE`)
- If the downloads themselves should be served via the proxy, which is when the logging occurs (`REWRITE_DOWNLOAD_URLS`)
- An allow-list of specific versions (`allowlist`)
- It is possible to define a webhook URL (`webhook-url`) where some of the details of blocked downloads will be sent. This can be useful in e.g., an environment with Slack to provide context for why a package isn't installable.

#### Scoping configurations

These configurations can be specified to logical units in your organization. If an organization is provided (the subdomain) then the 
proxy will look in the KV store for `org-<ORGNAME>` (example, acme.packageproxy.dev would be configured in `org-acme`). Otherwise, the 
`default` key configuration is used. If there is no configuration present, a default one will be created that contains the value in 
`./scripts/default-kv.json`. This file can be edited and pushed to the KV store using the `npx wrangler kv` command, or via the 
[web dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com).

#### Changing rule values

The rules live in the KV store. In order to change them manually:
1. Log into the Cloudflare [dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. Click "Storage & databases" > "Workers KV"
3. Click on the KV store linked to your Package Proxy
4. Click on the "KV Pairs" tab
5. Click "View" on the `org-<ORGNAME>` key, then "Edit"
6. Update the configuration value you want to change, then click "Save". The change will be immediately avaiable (within a second or two) to the Worker, there is no further action necessary.

One could also use wrangler:

1. Fetch the current settings:
```
$ namespace_id=$( \
    npx wrangler kv namespace list | \
    jq -r '.[] | select(.title | endswith("package-proxy")) | .id' \
    )
$ org_name=$(npx wrangler kv key list --remote --namespace-id "${namespace_id}" | jq -r '.[] | select(.name | startswith("org-")) | .name')
$ npx wrangler kv key get --remote --namespace-id "${namespace_id}" "${org_name}" > "${org_name}.json"
```
2. Now edit `${org_name}.json`, update your rules, and save.
3. Confirm it's still valid JSON:
```
$ jq . "${org_name}.json"
```
4. Finally, write back to Cloudflare:
```
$ npx wrangler kv key put --remote --namespace-id "${namespace_id}" "${org_name}" "$(cat ${org_name}.json)"
```

## Observability
Once the proxy has been used to install packages, it will log the user and organization into the created D1 database. These can be queried or explored via the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com), `wrangler` CLI, or [API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/d1).

Some example queries include:
- Return all the users that have installed a package (and each version): `SELECT DISTINCT UserId, CONCAT(PackageName, '@', PackageVersion) as Installed FROM Installs WHERE PackageName LIKE ?;` 
- Fetch the total number of installed packages: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Installs;`
- Fetch all installed package names: `SELECT DISTINCT PackageName FROM Installs;`

With Wrangler, these become:
```
# Names of all installed packages
$ npx wrangler d1 execute install-logs --remote --command 'SELECT DISTINCT PackageName FROM Installs'

# Find out who has installed requests
$ npx wrangler d1 execute install-logs --remote --command "SELECT DISTINCT UserId, CONCAT(PackageName, '@', PackageVersion) as Installed FROM Installs WHERE PackageName LIKE '%requests'"

# Total number of installed packages
$ npx wrangler d1 execute install-logs --remote --command 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Installs'
```
